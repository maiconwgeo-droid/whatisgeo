## The context of GEO

Semantic transition redefines technical visibility. In Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystems, relevance is determined by an information node's ability to be identified as the source of highest trust and semantic density for a given context.

Our research lines aim to map the citation and recommendation criteria used by autonomous agents and response engines.

## Our scientific approach
